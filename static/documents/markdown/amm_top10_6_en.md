## AMM Swap Tournament (Round #6)

We will rank each user's DPR/ETH trading volume between April 15, 0:00 AM (UTC) and April 22, 0:00 AM (UTC). Each of the top 10 users will win the right to purchase DPR at $0.02.

### Rules

1) Each winning address is eligible to purchase up to 100,000 DPR.

2) After the winners are announced, they need to transfer US$2,000 worth of LRC to the Layer2 account of **earn.loopring.eth** within 48 hours. If the transfer is not done in time, we will remove the user from the list.

3) DPR price: $0.02.

4) LRC price: CoinMarketCap close price on April 22.

5) For the winners who completed the transfer, we will transfer 30% of the purchased DPR (30,000DPR) to your Loopring Layer 2 account within seven days, and the remaining 70% will be distributed in installments of 7% every month for ten months.

6) The DPR/ETH swap tournament and our [DPR lottery event](https://medium.loopring.io/trade-dpr-on-loopring-layer2-million-dpr-at-your-grasp-9f870fd9ca2b) end on the same day, and the top 10 winners of the swap tournament cannot participate in the lottery event at the same time.
