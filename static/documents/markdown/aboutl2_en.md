# Layer2 account


Loopring Wallet has two accounts: Ethereum account (layer1) and Loopring account (layer2). What is the difference between these two accounts?

When you are using an Ethereum account (first floor), if the Ethereum network is congested, your experience will feel slow and the cost will be high.

With a Loopring layer2 account, you are equivalent to entering the fast channel of Ethereum. After you create the wallet, you only need to click on the homepage to activate the layer2 account for free, and then you can use the layer2 fast transfer and transaction, which is completely unaffected by the layer2 network congestion.


## Advantage
The second layer of Loopring account has the following advantages:

### 1.Security

Security is the top priority of Loopring Wallet. The wallet does not custody the user's assets, and the user's assets are absolutely safe. This guarantees that users can withdraw all their assets under any circumstances.

### 2.Support fast transactions and transfers

The first layer of Ethereum processes 15 transactions per second, and the throughput of Loopringâ€™s layer2 has increased hundreds of times, and it can process 4000 transactions per second. Without sacrificing security, we provide a trading experience comparable to that of a centralized exchange.

### 3.Low fee

With a Loopring layer2 account, you can experience low fee layer2 transfers. In addition, Loopring's layer2 trading order holders are exempt from fees, and the fee for users who take orders is 0.06%-0.2%. The handling fee of 0.06% order taking is the lowest among all centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges.
