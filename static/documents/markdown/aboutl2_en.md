# Layer2 account


Loopring Wallet has two accounts: an Ethereum account (Layer1) and a Loopring account (Layer2). What is the difference between these two accounts?

When you are using an Ethereum account (first floor), if the Ethereum network is congested, your experience will feel slow and the cost will be high. This is because you are interacting with the Ethereum (Layer1) chain directly, waiting for Layer1 blocks and paying Layer1 gas-fees.

With a Loopring Layer2 account, it is the equivalent of entering into the fast lane of Ethereum. After you create your wallet, you only need to click on the homepage to activate the Layer2 account for free. Now, you are enabled to use the extremely fast and cheap transfers and transactions of Layer2, which is completely unaffected by any network congestion.


## Advantages
The Loopring account second layer has the following advantages:

### 1.Security

Security is the top priority of Loopring Wallet. The wallet does not have custody of the user's assets, and the user's assets are absolutely safe. This guarantees that users can withdraw all their assets (back to Layer1) under any circumstances.

### 2.Fast transactions and transfers

The first layer of Ethereum processes only 15 transactions per second, while the throughput of Loopringâ€™s layer2 has scaled this hundreds of times, as it can process 4000 transactions per second. Without sacrificing security, we provide a trading experience comparable to that of a centralized exchange.

### 3.Low fees

With a Loopring Layer2 account, you can experience Layer2 transfers for an extremely low fee. In addition, Loopring Layer2 traders (provider maker orders) are exempt from fees, while the fee for users who provide taker orders is only 0.06%-0.2%. The handling fee of just 0.06% for taker orders is the lowest among all centralized exchanges and decentralized exchanges.
