### Product description

Prices, descriptions or availability of Products are outlined in the respective sections of this Application and are subject to change without notice.

While Products on this Application are presented with the greatest accuracy technically possible, representation on this Application through any means (including, as the case may be, graphic material, images, colors, sounds) is for reference only and implies no warranty as to the characteristics of the purchased Product.

The characteristics of the chosen Product will be outlined during the purchasing process.

### Purchasing process

Any steps taken from choosing a Product to order submission form part of the purchasing process.

The purchasing process includes these steps:

*   Users must choose the desired Product and verify their purchase selection.
*   After having reviewed the information displayed in the purchase selection, Users may place the order by submitting it.

### Order submission

When the User submits an order, the following applies:

*   The submission of an order determines contract conclusion and therefore creates for the User the obligation to pay the price, taxes and possible further fees and expenses, as specified on the order page.
*   In case the purchased Product requires active input from the User, such as the provision of personal information or data, specifications or special wishes, the order submission creates an obligation for the User to cooperate accordingly.

All notifications related to the described purchasing process shall be sent to the email address provided by the User for such purposes.

### Prices

Users are informed during the purchasing process and before order submission, about any fees, taxes and costs (including, if any, delivery costs) that they will be charged.

Prices on this Application are displayed:

*   either exclusive or inclusive of any applicable fees, taxes and costs, depending on the section the User is browsing.

### Methods of payment

Information related to accepted payment methods are made available during the purchasing process.

Some payment methods may only be available subject to additional conditions or fees. In such cases related information can be found in the dedicated section of this Application.

All payments are independently processed through third-party services. Therefore, this Application does not collect any payment information – such as credit card details – but only receives a notification once the payment has been successfully completed.

If payment through the available methods fail or is refused by the payment service provider, the Owner shall be under no obligation to fulfil the purchase order. Any possible costs or fees resulting from the failed or refused payment shall be borne by the User.

### Virtual Currency for exclusive use inside this Application

On this Application certain payments may be made using a Virtual Currency. Unless otherwise stated, such Virtual Currency is not tradable, exchangeable or redeemable against any traditional currency, any other open digital currency, goods or any other values.

By purchasing Virtual Currency, Users acknowledge and understand that it may only be used within this Application for the purposes expressly authorized by the Owner within the framework of its Services. Users also acknowledge and agree that they may not transfer, purchase, sell, or exchange such Virtual Currency outside of the Service.

Accordingly, Users may not sublicense, trade, sell or attempt to sell Virtual Currency for money, or exchange Virtual Currency for value of any kind outside of the dedicated offering provided by the Owner through this Application. Any such prohibited use or transaction shall be considered null and void and could result in legal action being taken against the User.

In case of contract or account termination for any cause attributable to the User, any and all unused Virtual Currency shall be forfeited and no refund shall be granted.

### Retention of usage rights

Users do not acquire any rights to use the purchased Product until the total purchase price is received by the Owner.

### Delivery

The purchased service shall be performed or made available within the timeframe specified on this Application or as communicated before the order submission.

Users acknowledge and accept that the purchase of services available on this Application may be subject to further conditions under applicable law, the Terms or any other related document.  
Users may be required to provide evidence or declare that such conditions – e.g. being considered an adult under applicable law – are met.  
In such situations, failure to meet the conditions set forth by law or contract may make it impossible to perform or deliver the services.

User rights
-----------

### Right of withdrawal

Unless exceptions apply, the User may be eligible to withdraw from the contract within the period specified below (generally 14 days), for any reason and without justification. Users can learn more about the withdrawal conditions within this section.

#### Who the right of withdrawal applies to

Unless any applicable exception is mentioned below, Users who are European Consumers are granted a statutory cancellation right under EU rules, to withdraw from contracts entered into online (distance contracts) within the specified period applicable to their case, for any reason and without justification.

Users that do not fit this qualification, cannot benefit from the rights described in this section.

#### Exercising the right of withdrawal

To exercise their right of withdrawal, Users must send to the Owner an unequivocal statement of their intention to withdraw from the contract.

To this end, Users may use the model withdrawal form available from within the “definitions” section of this document. Users are, however, free to express their intention to withdraw from the contract by making an unequivocal statement in any other suitable way. In order to meet the deadline within which they can exercise such right, Users must send the withdrawal notice before the withdrawal period expires.

When does the withdrawal period expire?

*   **Regarding the purchase of a service**, the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day that the contract is entered into, unless the User has waived the withdrawal right.

*   **In case of purchase of a digital content not supplied in a tangible medium**, the withdrawal period expires 14 days after the day that the contract is entered into, unless the User has waived the withdrawal right.

#### Effects of withdrawal

Users who correctly withdraw from a contract will be reimbursed by the Owner for all payments made to the Owner, including, if any, those covering the costs of delivery.

However, any additional costs resulting from the choice of a particular delivery method other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by the Owner, will not be reimbursed.

Such reimbursement shall be made without undue delay and, in any event, no later than 14 days from the day on which the Owner is informed of the User’s decision to withdraw from the contract. Unless otherwise agreed with the User, reimbursements will be made using the same means of payment as used to process the initial transaction. In any event, the User shall not incur any costs or fees as a result of such reimbursement.

##### …on the purchase of services

Where a User exercises the right of withdrawal after having requested that the service be performed before the withdrawal period expires, the User shall pay to the Owner an amount which is in proportion to the part of service provided.

Such payment shall be calculated based on the economic value of the service and be proportional to the part of service provided until the time the User withdraws compared to the full coverage of the contract.

Notwithstanding the above, the following limitation applies to all Users not qualifying as Consumers:

In any event of liability, the compensation may not exceed the total payments that have been, will be or would be received by the Owner from the User based on the contract over a period of 12 months, or the period of the duration of the Agreement, if shorter.
