### What is ETH staking via Lido?

Lido is a liquid staking solution for ETH 2.0 backed by industry-leading staking providers. Lido lets users stake their
ETH - without locking assets or maintaining infrastructure.

When using Lido to stake your ETH on the Ethereum beacon chain, users will receive a token (stETH), which represents
their ETH on the Ethereum beacon chain on a 1:1 basis. It effectively acts as a bridge bringing ETH 2.0’s staking
rewards to ETH 1.0.

wstETH is the wrapped version of stETH. The total amount of wstETH doesn’t change after users receive the token.
Instead, the token’s value increase over time to reflect ETH staking rewards earned.

### Risk Disclosure

It is important to note that users can't redeem wstETH for ETH until phase 2 of Ethereum 2.0. However, users are able to
trade wstETH for ETH on various exchanges at market prices.

Loopring will provide a pool to allow users to trade wstETH for ETH directly on Layer 2. The pool will rebalance
periodically when it reaches a specific threshold. If there is not enough inventory on Layer 2, user can always withdraw
their wstETH tokens to Layer 1 and swap for ETH in Lido, Curve, or 1inch.
