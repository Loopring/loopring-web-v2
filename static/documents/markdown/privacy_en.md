# PRIVACY POLICY


This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Loopring Technology Limited (“**we**”, “**our**”, “**us**” or “**Loopring**”) regarding the collection, retention, use, management and protection of user information on applications and products offered by Loopring (including Loopring Smart Wallet (the “**Wallet**” or “**Loopring Wallet”**)) and Loopring Exchange, collectively, “**Services**” or “**Loopring Services**”)).  This Privacy Policy applies to all functions of Loopring Wallet and Loopring Exchange operated by Loopring, including but not limited to services such as wallet creation, transfer, wire, transaction, deposit and withdrawal, guardian management and reward collection.  We recommend that you carefully read and understand the entire content of this Privacy Policy before using Loopring Services.

## 1. OVERVIEW

The applications provided by Loopring are decentralized wallets and non-custodial exchanges. In general, Loopring's collection of user information is very limited.  Nevertheless, when you use the Loopring app and related services (for example, when you fill in the information as prompted by the page information, complete the creation or restore the wallet address), in order to ensure your normal use of our services, Loopring will also collect and use your personal information. We will strictly abide by the principles of openness, legality, legitimacy and necessity to collect your personal information. We will not share your information with third parties except to provide you with our services and products, to comply with the law or to protect our rights. **By using our Loopring Services, including downloading one of our mobile applications and visiting our website, you agree to the collection, retention, use, management and protection of information outlined in this Privacy Policy.**

## 2. INFORMATION COLLECTION

2.1. In order to provide you with the wallet service, we need to collect the following basic user information (“**User Information**”) that must be collected to provide you with the service:


- (a) Account information: When you create and restore a Wallet, we need your email address or mobile phone number. This
  information will be used when performing guardian-related operations and will also be used by us for user modeling to
  provide better services.

- (b) Wallet information: When you use the Wallet service, we will automatically collect the version information of your
  Wallet.

- (c) Device information: We will collect the relevant information of your device using our services, including device
  ID, version information of the mobile device operating system, mobile device platform type (iOS or Android), phone
  language, channel information (e.g., GooglePlay, Apple App Store), IP address in order to provide statistical analysis
  services, and calibrate the accuracy of report data through geographic location to provide basic anti-fraud function.

- (d) KYC (Know Your Customer) information: Loopring may provide some centralized services in the future. At that time,
  your identity, address and other information will be collected. Also loopring integrates services from 3rd party
  vendors (e.g., Ramp, BanXa) for fiat on-ramp and off-ramp solution, which will redirect user to 3rd party website. And
  user will need to fill in the KYC information in those web sites to receive services. This information is only used
  for compliance purposes.

When you use the Loopring account, the wallet address, ENS name, and all first-level transaction records related to the address (ENS name) (including but not limited to transfer, transaction, deposit, and withdrawal, etc.) will be stored on the Ethereum blockchain. You and we have no control over the disclosure, modification and deletion of your transaction records on the Ethereum blockchain.

2.3. When you are re-directed to a third-party DApp through Loopring Wallet, the third-party DApp may collect your personal information. If you refuse the third-party DApp to collect such information when providing services, you may not be able to use such third-party DApp in the Loopring Wallet.
