# What is Dual Investment?

Dual Investment is a non-principal protected structured product. Upon purchasing, you can select the underlying asset,
investment currency, investment amount, and delivery date. Your return will be denominated in the investment currency or
alternate currency, depending on the below conditions.

There are two types of Dual Investment products: “Buy Low” and “Sell High”.

Buy Low products gives you a chance to buy your desired crypto (such as LRC) at a lower price in the future with
stablecoins (USDT).

- Target Reached: On the Settlement Date, if the Market Price is at or below the Target Price, the target currency (LRC)
  will be bought;
- Target Not Reached: On the Settlement Date, if the Market Price is above the Target Price, then you will keep your
  stablecoins;  
  In both scenarios, you will first earn interest in stablecoins. Once the Target Price is reached, your subscription
  amount and interest income will be used to buy LRC.

Sell High products gives you a chance to sell your existing crypto (such as LRC) at a higher price in the future (for
USDT).

- Target Reached: On the Settlement Date, the Market Price is at or above the Target Price, your LRC will be sold for
  USDT.
- Target Not Reached: On the Settlement Date, the Market Price is below the Target Price, then you will keep your LRC.  
  In both scenarios, you will first earn interest in your existing currency (LRC). Once the Target Price is reached,
  your subscription amount and interest income will be sold for USDT.

Your token for investment is just locked but still in your account as Loopring is a DEX.

Each purchased product has a settlement date. We will take an average of the market price in the last 30 minutes before
16:00 (UTC+8) on the delivery date as the settlement price.

> **Please make sure that you fully understand the product and the risks before investing.**

## How to calculate my return?

When the target price is reached, your investment and interest income will be converted into USDT with a target price as
the conversion rate.

### Example 1:

###### Invest LRC for LRC-USDT Dual Investment

```text 
Target Price: 0.48   
Settlement Date: 21-AUG-2022   
ROI: 0.6%  
APR: 73%  
Investment Currency: LRC  
```

Assume that the current time is August 18th, the LRC price is 0.42, and the user chooses to invest 1,000 LRC in Dual
Investment due in the week.

###### At 21-AUG-2022

- Scenario 1
    - `If the Settlement Price of LRC on that day is lower than the Target Price of 0.48 USDT, the user will get 0.6% of LRC, that is, 1000 * (1 + 0.6%) LRC = 1006 LRC.`
- Scenario 2
    - `If the Settlement Price of LRC is higher than the Target Price of 0.48 USDT, the end user will get 0.6% of USDT, that is, 1000 * 0.48 * (1 + 0.6%) USDT = 482.88 USDT.`

After the order expires, the user will get 0.6% of the income. The only uncertainty is the currency of the return, which
depends on the LRC/USDT settlement price at the time of expiration.

### Example 2:

###### Invest USDT for LRC-USDT Dual Investment

```text 
Target Price: 0.38  
Settlement Date: 21-AUG-2022  
ROI: 0.6%  
APR: 73%  
Investment Currency: USDT  
```

Assume that the current time is August 18th, the LRC price is 0.42, and the user chooses to invest 1,000 USDT in Dual
Investment due in one week.

###### At 21-AUG-2022

- Scenario 1
    - `the Settlement Price of LRC on that day is lower than the Target Price of 0.38 USDT, the user will get 0.6% of LRC, that is, (1000/0.38) * (1 + 0.6%) LRC = 2647.368 LRC.`
- Scenario 2
    - `If the settlement price of LRC is higher than the Target Price of 0.38 USDT, the end user will receive 0.6% of USDT, that is, 1000 * (1 + 0.6%) USDT = 1006 USDT.`

After the order expires, the user will get 0.6% of the income. The only uncertainty is the currency of the return, which
depends on the LRC/USDT settlement price at the time of expiration.
