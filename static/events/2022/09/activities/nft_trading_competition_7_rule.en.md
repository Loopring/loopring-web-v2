### Rules


1. Users who use any of the qualifying NFT Marketplaces(collecting + paying royalties to the NFT creators) built on Loopring L2 to buy or sell NFTs will have a chance to win a Loophead NFT. 

2. How to Win your Loophead NFT:

   1）Be one of the  **Top 900 NFT traders** (buying and/or selling volume) during the qualifying period.
   
   2）Or try your luck with the Lucky Draw as **1000 addresses** will be selected at random to win. To be eligible for the lucky draw, you must place NFT trades over the entire eligibility period that accumulate to **a total of at least $250 USD equivalent**.
   
   3）The lucky draw will work on a ticketing system, where one ticket receives one entry into the lucky draw — the tickets will be rewarded as follows:
      
      ✅ Top 901–1200 NFT traders (by volume) receive 5 tickets *
      
      ✅ Top 1201–1500 NFT traders (by volume) receive 4 tickets *
      
      ✅ Top 1501–1800 NFT traders (by volume) receive 3 tickets *
      
      ✅ Top 1801–2100 NFT traders (by volume) receive 2 tickets *
      
      ✅ Top 2101+ NFT traders (by volume) receive 1 ticket *

3. We calculate the total NFT trading volume for each address that is buying/selling NFTs on a qualifying marketplace and total volumes are measured in $USD.

4. We will only count trades placed on qualifying NFT marketplaces that pay out royalties to creators (even if the royalty set on an NFT is 0%).

5. Wash trading will not be counted towards the competition.

6. Addresses can only win one Loophead.

7. Loopring reserves the right of final decision and interpretation of the rules.
