    "description": "YMPL is a probabilistic DeFi protocol that rebases the token supply in a set of intervals based on probabilistic model. YMPL s not a stablecoin, no price target of $1. Its price discovery is purely based on the demands and supply of the market and chances. Simply put, the total supply of YMPL will be dynamically increased and decreased based on its ETH price ratio, rebasing chances, multiplier chances and market demand. YMPL is a truly unique commodity, an alternative store of value backed by probability where its price is discovered by the free and decentralized market.",
